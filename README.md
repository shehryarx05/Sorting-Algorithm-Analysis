This Repository Contains The Code And Data Used In My Experimental Study Comparing The Practical Performance Of Four Sorting Algorithms: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, And Merge Sort. The Codes Generate Random Datasets, Measure Execution Times Across Increasing Input Sizes, And Produce The Results Shown In My Research Paper.

Contents

sorting_test.py: Sorting Functions And Timing Logic + Data Generation

multiple_trials.py: Averaged Execution Times

data.json: Recorded Execution Times From Experimental Runs

How To Run

Install Python 3.10+ And Run:

sorting_test.py First, Then Run multiple_trials.py. This Would Create A Data Folder With Graphs And Another Folder With A Json File.
